# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues privately. Do not open public issues for active vulnerabilities.

Preferred path:
1. Open a private security advisory in the repository.
2. Include reproduction steps, impact, and affected files/components.
3. Include your proposed mitigation if available.

If private advisories are not available in your hosting setup, contact the maintainers directly before public disclosure.

## Supported Versions
Security fixes are applied to the latest mainline codebase first. Older snapshots may not receive backported fixes.

## Disclosure Process
- We acknowledge valid reports as quickly as possible.
- We triage severity and define remediation scope.
- We ship a fix, then coordinate disclosure notes and upgrade guidance.
